VRM Development v2.3.0
Needed Functionality
1. Need HTML email builder with capability to add distribution list (Tribe), individual contacts as well
as create automated emails (likely a separate determination when creating a new email) that
send on pre-determined workflow or auto response. We will also want to create the capability to
create drip campaigns that automate based on trigger events.
2. Need text builder with capability to add distribution list, automate send on predetermined
workflow.
3. Need automation – workflow for automation should be that any text or email can be set as a
trigger to any form or action – like signup, text opt-in to a set phone number, etc.
Login
1. Relationship Mode needs to be the default area after logging in.
2. We will want to create a more bold color change between each mode so there’s no mistaking
what mode a user is in.
3. Instead of a drop down to move between modes, can it be buttons in the header? Only
subscribed modes should display to the user. Relationship, Campaign, Petition
4. Add a second pop-up confirmation before changing modes. “Enter [mode]? Yes / No”
Relationship Mode – Navigation (shown in order)
1. Dashboard (good)
2. Tribes (add- this is the list builder – need static and dynamic list functionality – dynamic is auto
listing based on forms, form responses)
3. Email (add & build based on the survey interface)
4. SMS (add & build)
5. Surveys – remove drop down and reserve this capability in Survey Dashboard
6. Forms – remove drop down and reserve this capability in the Forms Dashboard
7. CTAs - remove drop down and reserve this capability in the CTA Dashboard
8. Delete “districts”
9. Roadmap (keep – I love this!)
Relationship Mode Dashboard
1. Change header to: Relationship Dashboard, Overview of your outreach metrics and activities
2. First row stats change to: Total Contacts | New Subscribers | Email Subscribers | Text
Subscribers (we should eventually make it so that individual metrics can be “favorited” to show up
here)
3. Change “Campaign Activity” to “Outreach Activity”
4. (I understand these are static right now) Overview – Demographics (delete “voter”) –
Engagement Stats (add “Engagement”)
a. Overview – % engaged, highest and lowest engaged outreach, average demographic
(users median age, sex, income, voter participation ranking, education) – we could also
use this data to generate voter personas and rank them in order of majority. For example:
my #1 persona is white females, aged 38, educated, stay at home mom. My #2 persona
is Hispanic male, blue collar, husband and father and person of faith. For people to be
able to see their demographic data as a person, it could really help formulate messaging.
b. Demographics – Age, sex, occupation, party, vote/no vote rank, income, education, city,
state
c. Engagement Stats (running 30 days – those who have engaged communications) –
SMS, email, phone, canvass, social media)

5. Recent activity:
a. New contacts (delete voter, running 24 hours)
b. Latest email blast
c. Latest SMS blast
d. Latest trigger automation
e. Latest form conversion

f. Latest donation
6. Remove all references to “voters” and replace with “contacts”
7. Remove all references to “group” and replace with “tribe”
8. Change most references to “campaign” and replace with “communication” – for example, change
“Campaign Dashboard” to “Communication Dashboard” – “Overview of key communication
metrics and activities” etc.
Relationship Mode – Contacts
1. Contacts – Build and manage your community relations.
2. Import, Export, + Add Contact, + Add Multiple Contacts
3. Add functionality to customize display of contacts and information – Default:
a. Name, Phone, Email, Party, Status, Address, City, State, County, Precinct, Congressional
District, Senate District, House District, School District, Voter Rank (we can also add
issues based displays)

4. Add functionality to add custom filters (males, in CD 6 and/or issues based)
5. Other key contact identifiers are donors, volunteers, voters in your current district (districts
change over time for candidates)
Relationship Mode – Calls to Action
1. Need to create a CTA dashboard that lists CTA conversion stats above a list of active CTAs that
can be clicked and edited.
2. The list will need to show views, conversions, etc. in a table layout.
3. Option to create a new CTA should be at the very top of the dashboard in the same position as
“add contact”
4. The builder is messed up. I got frustrated right away. We’ll need to come up with a consistent
builder with an intuitive and robust layout. I’ll send some layout examples.
Campaign Mode - Organization
10. Change “Voters” to “Contacts”
11. Delete “Campaigns” folder organization – just use Email, SMS, Voter Groups (Change “Voter
Groups” to “Tribes”)
5. The builder should be consistent logic / user interface as the email builder.
Relationship Mode – Surveys
1. Create Survey Dashboard that lists survey stats above list of active and completed surveys that
can be clicked for survey reports and insights.
2. Option to create new survey should be displayed at the upper right corner like “add contact”
3. Add static text to this with options to use Heading Style/Paragraph Style (these styles should be
defined in the brand settings)
4. What is “recipient email?”
5. Re-Order Field Types
a. Static Text
b. Radio Buttons
c. Check Boxes
d. Rating Scale
e. Range Slider
f. Drop Down
g. Text Area
h. Text Input
i. Email
j. Number
k. Phone
l. Email
m. Website URL
Relationship Mode – Forms
1. Eliminate form submission views – see dashboard

2. Create forms dashboard that lists all form stats above list of published and unpublished forms that
can be clicked to view form submissions, form conversion data and provide option to edit live
forms.
3. Option to create new form should be displayed on the top right like “add contact”
4. Copy nearly exact functionality and interface of the survey builder.
5. Couldn’t find embed code, add “publish” or something like that to confirm the form is completed.
